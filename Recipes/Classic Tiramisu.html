    <h3>This is mostly because tiramisu is one of two desserts that my mom always orders at restaurants
        (the other being crème brulee; she likes a classic). 
        I'd honestly never encountered tiramisu outside of a restaurant setting! </h3>
    
    <p>But a few years ago this changed when we hosted our first Christmas dinner and my mom requested tiramisu for dessert. 
        I was definitely a little fearful but went into "what's the worst that could happen?" mode.</p>
    <p>It turns out that making a good tiramisu at home isn't really all that difficult. 
        It really just requires a little patience, some solid whisking, and a few tips to help you along!</p>

    <ul>
        <P>Ingredients</P>

        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) sugar, divided</li>
        <li>3 ounces (6 tablespoons) dark rum, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) mascarpone cheese, cold from the fridge</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream, cold from the fridge</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 (7-ounce) package ladyfingers</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-processed) for dusting the top</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>

        <p>Directions</p>

        <li>Lightly oil an 8x8-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li> Set a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water to create a double boiler (the bowl should rest on the rim of the pan and the bottom should not touch the surface of the water).

            Whisk together the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of the sugar in the bowl. Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved, the mixture has increased slightly in volume, and it looks light yellow color. Not sure? Rub a little of the mixture between two fingers (it will be warm, but not too hot to touch) – it should feel smooth and silky; if you feel any sugar granules, keep whisking. </li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the rum and continue whisking rapidly over the double boiler for about 10 minutes, until the mixture is thick, foamy, and very pale yellow. (You can also use a hand mixer for this step, if you prefer.)</li>

    </ol>
