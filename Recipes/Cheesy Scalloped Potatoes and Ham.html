    <h3>These easy scalloped potatoes from scratch are even better than Grandma's. Here's how to cook them perfectly every time.</h3>
    <p>Russet potatoes are preferred. 
        You can definitely use other potato varieties like Yukon Gold if you'd like! 
        We prefer russets because they break down faster and retain less of their structure, giving you that classic fork-tender creaminess.
        </p>
    <p>Slice the potatoes as thinly as possible. 
        If you've got a mandolin, it'll make your life a whole lot easier. 
        If you don't, no worries! Think of this as knife skills practice. 
        You're looking for each slice to be about 1/4" but a little unevenness won't make or break this recipe </p>

</li>

<li>6 slices bacon, chopped into "1" pieces
</li>

<li>3 tbsp. butter
</li>

<li>3garlic cloves, minced
3 tbsp.</li>

<li> 1 c.

    low-sodium chicken broth</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>

    <p>Directions</p>

<li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy, about 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>

<li>In another large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in flour and cook for another minute. Whisk in cream and chicken broth and season with salt and pepper. Simmer until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
<li>Peel potatoes and thinly slice each potato crosswise into thin coins. (A mandolin would work great here.)</li>
<li>Spoon a thin layer of sauce into the bottom of a large casserole dish. Add a single layer of potatoes on top. Spoon more sauce over the potatoes and top with cheese and bacon. Repeat 3 to 4 times, or until the casserole dish is mostly full.</li>
<li>Bake until the sauce is bubbly and the potatoes are very tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before serving.</li>
